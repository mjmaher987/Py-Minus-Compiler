## Phase 1 - Scanner
Phase 1 is a simple scanner which scans inputs, coverts them to tokens, and then save them in a file as a table.

## Phase 2 - Parser
Phase 2 is the parser of this compiler. Parse tree is created in this phase.

## Phase 3 - Code Genertor
This phase is the main part of the compiler, because the median code is generated.

## Phase 4 - Semantic Analyser
